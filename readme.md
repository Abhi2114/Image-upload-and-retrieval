# Image Upload and Retrieval

To run the app:
1) Clone the project.
2) Navigate to the root folder and run 'npm install'. This will install all required dependencies for the project.
3) Finally, run 'npm start' on the root again to start the server.

### Install MongoDB locally on your system or set it up on the cloud yourself because the URI in my code won't work for you.

### All images uploaded will be stored on the server file system and are just pointed to by on the database(the DB only stores references). You can change the code to store them on the database itself(using GridFS) if you like.
